Author Customization
=========================

[Author Customization](https://christiaanconover.com/code/wp-author-customization) is a WordPress plugin that extends the ability to customize post & page authors beyond the native abilities of WordPress. It gives greater flexibility for use cases where the traditional “blog post author” model may not be exactly what’s needed.

Features
--------
* __Per-post author information__: Store information such as display name and biographical info in a post’s metadata, with the option to use either the per-post author info or the global author info when displaying the post. This is useful if you want to keep author information as it was when the post was originally published, or if the author wants to add custom messages to their bio based on the topic of the post.
* __WYSIWYG/TinyMCE editor for biographical info__: Allow authors to make their bio entries richer using TinyMCE, the native rich editor in WordPress.
* __rel="nofollow" for links in author bio entries__: If your authors do place links in their bio entries, you don’t have to worry about those links affecting your search engine ranking. The plugin adds a rel="nofollow" attribute to every link found in an author’s bio.
